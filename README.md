# Zoo Master Application

## Overview

This application is developed to coordinate zoo visits, catering to a scenario where the zoo houses 18 different species of animals. Visitors are grouped and assigned specific sets of animals to observe. After completing their assigned visits, visitors rotate through groups until they've seen all the animals at the petting zoo.

By default, visitors are organized into 6 groups. However, adjustments are made based on the number of visitors, ensuring a seamless experience. To add variety, animals are randomly assigned to each group.
